EduNexus AI — Application Overview for LLM Consumption
=====================================================

1. Product Summary
------------------
EduNexus AI is a prototype academic management portal that simulates a modern institute dashboard experience for multiple roles (Students, Parents, Teachers, HODs, Deans, and institutional leadership). The app emphasizes a responsive React frontend with contextual dashboards, profile handling, AI study guidance callouts, attendance insights, marks summaries, and basic task assignment workflows. Data persistence is mocked via local context providers, enabling demo-ready flows without a backend.

2. Core Functional Areas
------------------------
2.1 Authentication & Routing
    - Login page supports role-aware flows (Student, Parent, Teacher, Dean) with Unique ID requirements.
    - Sign-up flow extends to teacher-specific metadata (title, subjects, class assignments).
    - HashRouter protects dashboard routes via a PrivateRoute component.

2.2 Role-based Dashboards
    - Student Dashboard: attendance overview, marks list, AI schedule planner, tasks assigned by teachers.
    - Parent Dashboard: child selection, announcements, profile view, multi-account “Switch Account” guidance.
    - Teacher/Dean Dashboard: class list management, task creation, document uploads, subject management, messaging placeholder.

2.3 Profile & Theme Handling
    - Centralized layout component showing user info, avatar control, and theme switcher.
    - Theme options (Light, Light Pink, Light Green, Light Brown, Dark) extend via custom CSS variables.
    - Dedicated Profile view (shared across roles) displays identity, role, email, and avatar updates through file input.

2.4 Student Tools
    - AI Study Planner call-to-action with message-driven schedule placeholder.
    - Timetable planner accepts available time slots, subjects (add/remove), and pulls subjects from mark data.
    - Tasks tab lists instructor assignments with status updates per student.

2.5 Teacher Utilities
    - Task management module supports assignment creation, per-student status review, and deletion.
    - Department management view enables title edits (rank-based permissions) and teacher removal.
    - Class view provides Manage Attendance/Marks placeholders and student listings.

3. Strengths
------------
3.1 Comprehensive Role Coverage
    - Every key stakeholder (student, parent, teacher, HOD/dean) has a tailored UI and data flow, demonstrating wide scenario coverage within a single app shell.

3.2 Modular React Architecture
    - Shared Layout, Card, Button, Input, Select components keep styling consistent and reduce duplication.
    - Context providers (AuthContext, DataContext, ThemeContext) keep mock state centralized and easy to extend.

3.3 UX Details & Accessibility
    - Avatar click flows into a profile screen before photo upload, matching user expectations and permission prompts.
    - Timetable and academic planner flows add chips, removal controls, and actionable feedback when data is missing (“NO, data found” message).
    - Theme switcher, responsive sidebars, and mobile-friendly controls indicate focus on usability.

3.4 Documentation & Reference Files
    - Dedicated textual datasets (`test-data/app-demo-dataset.txt`, `data/dummy_login_reference.txt`) provide realistic sample data for testing without touching runtime code.

4. Limitations / Areas Lacking
------------------------------
4.1 No Real Backend or API Layer
    - All data is in-memory; refreshes reset state. No persistence, authentication tokens, or server validation.

4.2 Limited Analytics & Insights
    - Attendance, marks, and AI planner are largely static placeholders. There is no charting on the new attendance message view, and the schedule generator does not compute actual plans.

4.3 Messaging/Announcements are Static
    - Teacher announcements and parent notifications exist as UI placeholders; there is no creation flow or data refresh mechanism.

4.4 Task Editing & Comments Missing
    - Teachers can create or delete tasks but cannot edit existing ones, attach resources, or add inline notes/comments.

4.5 Accessibility & i18n Not Fully Addressed
    - While some aria labels exist, there is no consistent focus management, keyboard shortcuts, or translation support.

4.6 Testing & QA
    - No automated tests, linting enforcement is manual, and there is no CI pipeline.

5. Enhancement Opportunities
----------------------------
5.1 Backend Integration
    - Add a REST/GraphQL API with authentication (JWT/OAuth), database persistence, and role-based authorization to transition from demo to production-ready system.

5.2 Real AI Planner & Analytics
    - Integrate an actual AI service (e.g., Gemini) to generate schedules, remedial topics, and study priorities based on marks and attendance.
    - Reinstate interactive charts for attendance and marks with data filters, comparison across semesters, and predictive warnings.

5.3 Assignment Workflows
    - Support attachments, inline grading, rubric creation, and per-student comments. Provide notifications when tasks update.

5.4 Messaging & Notifications
    - Build a messaging center where teachers/admins send announcements, parents acknowledge messages, and students receive reminders.

5.5 Parent Multi-Account Switching
    - Instead of guidance text, implement actual account switching with secure token handling for multiple children/wards.

5.6 Mobile Optimization & Offline Mode
    - Add PWA capabilities, caching strategies, and more mobile-first layout adjustments.

5.7 Accessibility & Localization
    - Enhance aria labels, offer keyboard shortcuts, and support localization (e.g., English + regional languages).

6. Conclusion
-------------
EduNexus AI is a strong functional prototype for academic dashboards, demonstrating cohesive UX and modular React patterns across roles. Its primary value lies in showcasing feature breadth—profile control, tasks, schedules, multi-role navigation—within a single codebase. To reach production readiness, the app needs data persistence, interactive analytics, richer communication workflows, and stronger accessibility/automation practices.
